Biological Neural Networks as Defense against Adversarial Attacks

Abstract: 
In recent years, more and more importance is given to interpretability in the machine learning field. The best
known and most famous area in which the interpretability of a neural network is needed is that of cyber-security.
The first paper to expose the potential issue is by Szegedy et al. (2014), in ”Intriguing properties of neural net-
works”, in which it is shown how an image, if altered in the right way, can be completely misclassified by a network
trained to classify images.
In this thesis I proposed a new method based on a hybrid network, i.e. half biological and half artificial, in order
to develop a neural network that shows adversarial robustness, capable of resisting to many different adversarial
attacks. The biological part will be based on the hebbian and anti-hebbian neural dynamics, while the artificial
one will be based on specialized neurons and probability.
